#problem : now the same images have different tags, so there will be dubplicates when displaying to the gallery.
# example : ( PlantVillage has interaction styles of pop-up messages, instrction ) So there will be one image for instrction, and one for pop-up messages, when displaying to the gallery.
#Solution : all items with the same image links (which is the ID here) are seperated by common, instead of seperating them into difft rows.
